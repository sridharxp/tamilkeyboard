Exposed function are
	STARTKEYBOARDHOOK
	RESUMEKEYBOARDHOOK
	STOPKEYBOARDHOOK
	SUSPENDKEYBOARDHOOK
	GETHOOKRECPOINTER
	SELECTKEYBOARD
	GETSTATUS
	GetAuthor

Typically you call SELECTKEYBOARD first
	SUSPENDKEYBOARDHOOK and	RESUMEKEYBOARDHOOK or
	SELECTKEYBOARD many times
	STOPKEYBOARDHOOK fnally.

STARTKEYBOARDHOOK, GETHOOKRECPOINTER, GETSTATUS are legacy functions. STARTKEYBOARDHOOK will be hidden.

SELECTKEYBOARD and RESUMEKEYBOARDHOOK need window handle. That is not used for anything now. But it can be used for two way communication between dll and the calling application. Like status Enabled, Disabled, Layout currenly in operation and any other information can be passed to the calling program.

Is there a case for simple SELECTKEYBOARD and SUMEKEYBOARDHOOK like functions without the Window handle parameter?
