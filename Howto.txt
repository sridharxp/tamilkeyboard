Exposed function are
	STARTKEYBOARDHOOK
	RESUMEKEYBOARDHOOK
	STOPKEYBOARDHOOK
	SUSPENDKEYBOARDHOOK
	GETHOOKRECPOINTER
	SELECTKEYBOARD
	GETSTATUS
	GetAuthor

Typically you call SELECTKEYBOARD first
	SUSPENDKEYBOARDHOOK and	RESUMEKEYBOARDHOOK or
	SELECTKEYBOARD many times
	STOPKEYBOARDHOOK fnally.

GETHOOKRECPOINTER is for low level use. GETSTATUS is legacy function. 

SELECTKEYBOARD and RESUMEKEYBOARDHOOK need window handle, integer type. That is not used for anything now. But it can be used for two way communication between dll and the calling application. Like status Enabled, Disabled, Layout currenly in operation and any other information can be passed to the calling program.

See DTHook.int for Delphi declaration.
Should be simple to modfy for VB use.
