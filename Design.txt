Technical:
Keys
    If any Visible key is not handled it is not passed back and so in effect
    a dead key.
Keyboard Logic
    An array of  last N ASCII characters ( Not Virtual Key codes) is used to
    calculate the Tamil character. Zero or one or more characters may have to be
    deleted first before the character is inserted.
    Map is searched with  N characters and if found an integer (Unicode Codepoint
    for Unicode font)  is sent as Keyboard input. If not found the last N-1
    characters are used to search and so on. If nothing found then the last
    character is counted as dead key character.
    N greater than 1 means that some characters are to be deleted.
    No of characters to delete = N-1 -dead key count


User Interface:
Typewriter
     Typewriting mode imitates our writing way, not the mechanical typewriter.
     Mechanical typewriter mode is a historical legacy we need not carry into future.
     Moreover SCIM does not impose these kind of limitations.
IISC Typewriter:
    Follows Gist Model
Inscript
    Follows Inscript Layout

Font:
IISC - Legacy Gist Font (Pre Tamil 99 Standard)
Tam - Tanil 99 Ansi Standard
Tau - Tamil Unicode Standard Font
